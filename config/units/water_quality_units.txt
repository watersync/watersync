# Water Quality Units Definition File
# This file defines custom units for water quality measurements
# Compatible with Pint UnitRegistry.load_definitions()

# Turbidity units
NTU = [turbidity]
FNU = [turbidity]  # Formazin Nephelometric Units
FTU = [turbidity]  # Formazin Turbidity Units

# Bacterial count units  
CFU = [count]  # Colony Forming Units
MPN = [count]  # Most Probable Number
MPNU = [count]  # Most Probable Number Units

# pH and chemical activity
pH_unit = [acidity]
pH = [acidity]

# Additional water quality specific units
ppm_as_CaCO3 = [mass] / [volume]  # Parts per million as calcium carbonate
mg_CaCO3_per_L = milligram / liter  # Hardness as CaCO3
equiv_per_L = [amount] / [volume]  # Chemical equivalents per liter
meq_per_L = milli * equiv_per_L  # Milliequivalents per liter

# Conductivity (already defined in Pint but adding aliases)
uS_per_cm = microsiemens / centimeter
mS_per_cm = millisiemens / centimeter

# Dissolved oxygen
mg_O2_per_L = milligram / liter  # Dissolved oxygen as O2
percent_saturation = [dimensionless]  # Percent saturation

# Chlorophyll
ug_chl_a_per_L = microgram / liter  # Chlorophyll-a

# Nitrogen and phosphorus compounds
mg_N_per_L = milligram / liter  # Nitrogen compounds
mg_P_per_L = milligram / liter  # Phosphorus compounds
mg_NH3_N_per_L = milligram / liter  # Ammonia as nitrogen
mg_NO3_N_per_L = milligram / liter  # Nitrate as nitrogen
mg_PO4_P_per_L = milligram / liter  # Phosphate as phosphorus
