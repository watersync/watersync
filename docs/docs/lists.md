# Lists

At a point, a generic html template for all lists was developed. Details are controlled in Django ListViews. Normally, all ListViews inherit from WatersyncListView that combines most of the shared functionality and settings for lists. The remaining settings are set in individual ListViews.

Lists are handled with HTMX.
