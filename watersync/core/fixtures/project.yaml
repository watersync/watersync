    name: "Kinrooi Wastewater Reuse Project"
    description: >
      Experimental project investigating wastewater reuse technologies and their environmental
      impact in eastern Flanders. This project focuses on monitoring water quality parameters
      before, during, and after wastewater treatment processes to assess the feasibility of
      water reuse for agricultural and industrial applications. The study includes monitoring
      of multiple treatment facilities and discharge points to evaluate treatment efficiency
      and environmental safety.
