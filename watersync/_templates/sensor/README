# Structure

## The `sensor` views

The `sensor` templates are at the same level as `project`. They all refer to
sensors that are owned by a user (just like the projects). They can also be 
owned by multiple users. 

## The `deployment` views

The `deployment` views on the other hand are coupled to (and routed through) the
`location, because we expect each deployment (aka sensor timeseries) to be
collected to a location which is always linked to a `project`.

## The `sensorrecord views

As the sensor records are usually numerous and collected in a non-organic way,
it does not make much sense to display them in the dashboard as a table but 
rather in a graphical form. Additionally there is a filtration option to 
retrieve and plot only required data and then download those data.

Moreover, the sensor records are always coupled to
a deployment (a combination of sensor and location). Because of this relation, 
it makes sense to not have separate views for them but rather include them in 
the deployment detail view.

In summary, the sensor records are always displayed (and are downloadable) from 
the level of sensor deployment.
