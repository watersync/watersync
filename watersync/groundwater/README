## models.py

In the groundwater level measurement model:

- created_at
- created_by
- updated_at
- updated_by

!!! important

    There should be a field representing the actual depth to groundwater with
    the height of the piezometer subtracted from it. As it happens that the
    piezometers can change the height, it should be immediatelly calculated and
    stored with the original measurement. BTW the original measurement should
    be from the the top of the casing to the grounwater level in the piezometer
    for simplified field data collection.

!!! idea

    We should assume that whenever a measurement is made at a locaiton, a status
    is also updated. So maybe we should link the measurement to the status
    update. That would allow to remove the comment field from the model and
    keep the commen togather with the status update.

## Outside of individual files

- allow to add a GWL measurement only to locations that have type 'well'
