# Structure

## Sample

Sample is always attached to a location. In the first version it only contains basic information:
- sample location
- timestamp
- JSON-formatted details of the sample

The list of samples will be a table with a Detail button. This template has to be reused in several places:
- samples view accessible under location/<location_pk>/samples
- detail-location 

## Measurements
Measurements are associated with a sample. A partial list template is also used here to be reused in:
- measurements list view.
- detail-sample detail view.
